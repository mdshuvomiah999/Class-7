          Mecca, city, western Saudi Arabia, located in the Ṣirāt Mountains,
          inland from the Red Sea coast. It is the holiest of Muslim cities.
          Muhammad, the founder of Islam, was born in Mecca, and it is toward
          this religious centre that Muslims turn five times daily in prayer
          (see qiblah). All devout and able Muslims attempt a hajj (pilgrimage)
          to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Because it is sacred, only
          Muslims are allowed to enter the city.

          The city existed for over 1,500 years before Muhammad's migration from
          Mecca, known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a
          rapidly-increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership,
          serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where
